## Piggyvest Calculator

Piggyvest  is a **fintech start-up** that aims at assisting imbibe the culture of savings and investments...which would later be of benefit to them.

### How is piggyvest different?

We'll...it offers a higher range of interests than the conventional banks, not just that it offers it's interest on a daily basis.

Piggyvest has six savings options:

Piggybank-the core savings option
Flex naira
Safelock
Targets
Flex dollar
Investify

These different options also come with different interest rates. There is no one single calculator that can calculate these rates and that's why this team has decided to work on a calculator with such function.

It would make it easier for first timers or even current users to weigh their options without moving from one tab to another.

The app can be used on all options to calculate a daily, monthly and yearly basis.

### How we came about our calculator

We the group of interns came together as a team and brainstormed...we understood how piggyvest works and we were able to come up with idaleas on how to go about it. 

We understood there were different interest rates for different plans and so we decided to put this all into design implementing our ideas with the basic piggyvest designs.

After the designs we began working on implementation of the designs and functions.

We ensured the basic functions of the calculator are working in collaboration with our design.

We also made the design responsive.
